BTN0: Reset clock.
BTN1: Hold
BTN2: Stop clock

1/2560 seconds is shown binary on the LED's.

The 7-segment display is organised like this:

|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|     |     |     |     |
| MIN | SEC | SEC | 1/10|
|     |     |     | SEC |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|


The watch is build using the following components:


## Prescaler ##

A prescaler is used to scale the clock down to 2560 Hz for the 1/2560 diplay.

Another prescaler is used to scale the clock down to 1Khz for the 7-segment display.

## Memory ##

Memory is used to store the counter state when hold is pressed.

## T Flip Flop ##

Two flipflops is used as a 2 bit to switch between the 7-segment displays

## Counter ##

5 different counters is used to keep track of the time.

## Debouncer ##

3 debouncers is used to prevent debouncing from the buttons.
